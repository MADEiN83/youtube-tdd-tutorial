# YouTube TDD tutorial

## Part 1

In this part, we'll see how to develop with TDD approach.
With a little exercise, we'll create a method named `countWords`. This method will help us to count words in a given sentence. Not a big algorithm, but it's enough to understand what is TDD and how to deal with.

Step by step, we'll create all needed unit tests in order to cover all cases of the algorithm.

## Part 2

The second part is bigger than the first one. Indeed, we'll work with a [Kata (Roman Numerals)](https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals) from [Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/).

This algorithm is more complex and will need more time to be cleared. Especially without TDD approach. We'll try to resolve the Kata and cover all use cases with unit tests.

## Part 3

I made the third part just to give you all needed unit tests (only, not the algorithm) for the second part. If you're struggling by writing your unit tests (for the second part), you can copy/past them and solve your Kata.

Otherwise, if you finish your second part, you can confirm your work with my unit tests. ;-)
